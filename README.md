# lz77-dis-var80
Implement LZ77 compression algorithm on TI-99/4a

The code here is written in C99C, a subset of the C language.
C99C is F.G. Kaal's Windows enhancement of C. Pulley's version of C.  http://ti99-geek.nl/Projects/c99c/c99c.html

Use compile.ps1 to compile the files locally from Windows and add a TI-HEADER to the resulting .O files.
Then load the .O files from an emulator like Classic 99.
